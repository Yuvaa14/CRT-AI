FATHER O AI:
     ---> "John McCarthy" is considered as the father of Artificial Intelligence. 
     ---> "John McCarthy" was an American computer scientist.
     ---> The term "artificial intelligence" was coined by him.
                                                  TITLE OF THE PROJECT
          NAME:Natural Language processing Chatbot.....
          DOMAIN:Arificial Intelligence

Description: Develop a chatbot that can understand and respond to user input using NLP techniques.

Steps:

1.Data Collection: Gather a dataset of sample conversations.
2.Text Preprocessing: Clean and tokenize the text data.
3.Intent Recognition: Use techniques like keyword matching or intent recognition models to understand user intent.
4.Response Generation: Design a response generation mechanism based on predefined templates or using sequence-to-sequence models.
5.User Interaction: Implement a user interface for users to interact with the chatbot.
6.Learning and Improvement: Integrate mechanisms for the chatbot to learn from user interactions and improve over time.
Tech Stack:

-> Python
-> Natural Language Processing libraries (NLTK, spaCy)
-> Deep Learning frameworks (TensorFlow or PyTorch).......
